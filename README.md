# iServ-Logger
Join Video Conferences of the iServ School Network automatically!

Since I graduated this summer and dont care about this code, feel free to use it for your school conferences!
The code was just written down in a few minutes in 2020 and the whole structure sucks - feel free to clean the project & fix some things
I wont update the Element IDs, if they ever change (what i doubt, since the whole platform sucks)

#How to use
1. Clone the Repository / Get the Release
2. Build on Debug / Release
3. Enter your iServ Credentials (Remember me)
4. Enter School URL (like this: https://evb-sh.eu/iserv)
5. Set the Conference Start and end
6. Get the **DIRECT** URL to join (like this: *.../videoconference/PCZsfhgJQ5uFvNXRBos3Wj*)
7. If you want to send a message once the automation joined the conference, you can use the last TextBox

After youve done, simply press on start and youre able to leave your pc now!
